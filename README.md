# 🦁 Zoo Management (Zoologic)

## 📌 Description

ZooManagement is a Java application that simulates a zoo by modeling different types of animals (mammals, birds, reptiles) and implementing their specific behaviors. The program utilizes inheritance and polymorphism to represent species diversity while also providing functionalities for managing events and tracking animals in the zoo.

✅ Zoo management: Add and remove animals, plan events, and track the zoo population.

✅ Information display: Show details about animals and list all species in the zoo.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

   * Language: Java
     
   * Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
